TODO:
Add missing quarto featues for PDF such as:
- description, 
- categories, 
- keywords, 
- center download button (if not ipynb)

To All:
 - Add sources of data (we probably need a special html comment to denote a data source, or special quarto comment!)
 - Add disclaimer link to /terms-of-service
 - Add Packages used and save a requirements.txt
 - And how comes categories in project directory `_metadata.yaml` are not added when displaying a post when other categories have been specified at the file level, but works when file yaml is in a file. Works in home page though


 ADD DISCLEIMER TO THE VERY END OF THE DOCUMENT
 EXPORT NOTEBOOK
 PREVENT RENDERING DRAFT DOCUMENTS
 RENDERING IMAGES IN THE NEW METADATA FORMAT WITHIN NOTEBOOK MARKDOWN - `image:` metadata extracted by `<!-- metadata: image -->` doesnt seem to work.

bibtex citations created with NOTEBOOK filter dont have title!

add counter https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=...
[`ipynb-output: all,none,best`](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/ipynb.html) does not WORK

links to run in deepnote and colab
