TODO:
Add missing quarto featues for PDF such as:
- description, 
- categories, 
- keywords, 
- center download button (if not ipynb)

To All:
 - Add sources of data (we probably need a special html comment to denote a data source, or special quarto comment!)
 - Add disclaimer link to /terms-of-service
 - Add Packages used and save a requirements.txt
 - And how comes categories in project directory `_metadata.yaml` are not added when displaying a post when other categories have been specified at the file level, but works when file yaml is in a file. Works in home page though
