    "Money Market Fund (MMF) is a unit trust investment, where fund managers raise money from public investors, and invest it collectively. Money Market Fund as a financial asset is short-term and highly liquid. Compared to bank deposits, Money Market offers a higher interest with a lower barrier of entry, in Kenya. Besides a higher interest, money moarket accounts offer compound interest unlike bank deposts which mostly offer simple interest. We will analyze Money market funds in Kenya in general using public information and hopefully paint a picture of the state of unit trust investments in Kenya."

    "### Who pays Fund Managers for managing money market fund investments?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't manage money market funds accounts. Fund managers invest the money on your behave. They invest the funds mostly in shortterm government papers (T-bill), company papers, bank deposits and a small portion is invested in long term asserts like real estate or long term bonds. Fund managers take a `2%` fee from the profit made from each of their investors. This provides an incentive to maximize the profit their investors get. Typically, this leaves with an net interest of between `1% - 5%` below the government of Kenya T-bills. For example, the current Treasury Bills on Offer at <https://www.centralbank.go.ke/bills-bonds/treasury-bills/> are:\n",

    "\n",
    "Going by the previous assumption, our money market fund account should currently return between `15% - 11%` approximately. Its important to recognize that how the fund managers invest determine the yield. for example, a fund manager who priritizes security over interest invest most of their money in safer assets that may have less return. The size of the investment portfolio also matters. fund managers with big assets have a harder time adjusting to higher interests, but also lower chances of downward fluctuations. Also, reputable fund managers who have a small porfolo have more incentive to lure more customers, so they take a less fee. Also, with a less assets to manage, a fund manager can invest all in a government paper, significanly offering a higher return, but theoretically exposing the investors to risk. Although it may be safe to say that the government paper is safe in that the government of kenya has never defaulted on any of its debt obligations, the investment is not diversified, which is risky. Some fund managers certainly offer a higher interest that that this, sometimes matching or surpusing government papers. This might be okay, but you owe to yourself an even greater burden of due dilligence.\n",

    "### Are Money market funds regulated in Kenya?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit trust Investments such as Money Market Funds are regulated by Capital Markets Authority (CMA)^[Capital Markets Authority (CMA) <https://www.cma.or.ke/about-us/>]. The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) is an independent public agency established in 1989 by an Act of Parliament, Capital Markets Act, Cap 485A ^[[THE CAPITAL MARKETS ACT - CHAPTER 485A - Revised Edition 2023 [1989] - Published by the National Council for Law Reporting](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730193048/https://www.cma.or.ke/download/18/acts/5077/capital-markets-act-2023.pdf)]. CMA is charged with the responsibility to oversee, license, and monitor the activities of market intermediaries, including the Stock Exchange, the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation(CDSC), Online Forex, Commodities and Regulated Exchanges^[CMA Regulatory Framework - Acts and Regulations - <https://www.cma.or.ke/regulatory-framework/>]. The CMA's primary mandate is to promote and maintain an orderly, fair, and efficient capital market in Kenya. Over the years, the CMA has regulated and supervised several market milestones such as the automation of trading at the Nairobi Securities Exchange^[[The Effect of Automation on Stock Market Trade](https://web.archive.org/web/20171031042240/http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/93863/Mwangi%20Michael%20M_The%20Effect%20of%20Automation%20on%20Stock%20Market%20Trade%20Volume%20at%20the%20Nairobi%20Securities%20Exchange..pdf)] ^[[NSE HISTORY - PDF](https://web.archive.org/web/20240617053341/https://www.nse.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/final-ar-min.pdf), [NSE HISTORY - Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730203221/https://www.nse.co.ke/our-story/)], the introduction of derivative markets, and the development of a robust regulatory framework^[<https://web.archive.org/web/20240718122736/https://www.cma.or.ke/regulatory-framework/>]. However, it has also faced challenges, such as insider trading scandals^[[Legal battle deny CMA insider trading fines](https://web.archive.org/web/20221007173416/https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/legal-battle-deny-cma-insider-trading-fines-3680374)] ^[[Insider Trading in Kenya and the Effectiveness of Its Sentencing in Light of Its Definition and Punishment in the United States of America and the United Kingdom](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4171294)] ^[[Tightening Loose Ends: Capital Markets Authority’s Power and Role in Combating Insider Trading](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730210258/https://www.oraro.co.ke/tightening-loose-ends-capital-markets-authoritys-power-and-role-in-combating-insider-trading/)] and the collapse of some investment firms^[[CMA to drop troubled firms from Kenyan stock market](https://web.archive.org/web/20240412114910/https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/cma-to-drop-troubled-firms-from-kenyan-stock-market-4536842)] ^[[Hard lessons in the collapse of stocks firms](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730212311/https://nation.africa/kenya/life-and-style/money/hard-lessons-in-the-collapse-of-stocks-firms-615610)] ^[[CMA to tighten unit trusts oversight after investor losses](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730212459/https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/market-news/cma-to-tighten-unit-trusts-oversight-after-investor-losses-2278788)], which have tested its regulatory effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a non exhaustive summary of some key areas that are regulated by CMA regarding Money Market Funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Licensing requirements:** *Fund managers must obtain a license from the CMA and meet minimum capital requirements.*<br/>\n",
    "According to the Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001 (last amended in 2021), fund managers in Kenya must obtain a license from the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) and meet specific capital requirements. For money market funds, the minimum paid-up capital requirement is 10 million Kenyan Shillings, while for other types of funds, it's 50 million Kenyan Shillings. Additionally, all fund managers must maintain a minimum net capital of 10 million Kenyan Shillings throughout their operations. These funds must be kept in a bank account or invested as specified by the CMA^[[Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001 (last amended in 2021)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730214559/https://www.cma.or.ke/download/34/regulations/5017/the-capital-markets-collective-investment-schemes-regulations-2023.pdf)].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Investment restrictions:**<br/>Money market funds are required to invest in low-risk, short-term debt instruments with a maximum maturity of 18 months ^[[Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001 (last amended in 2021)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240730214559/https://www.cma.or.ke/download/34/regulations/5017/the-capital-markets-collective-investment-schemes-regulations-2023.pdf), Part VIII, section 102.1.a].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diversification rules:** *Funds must maintain a diversified portfolio, with limits on exposure to single issuers or sectors.* <br/>\n",
    "Regulation 78(1) states that a scheme shall not invest more than 25% of its net asset value in any one issuer, with an exception for government securities where the limit is 30% ^[Regulation 78(1) and Regulation 78(2)(b) of the Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001.].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Valuation and pricing:** *Daily valuation of fund assets and use of amortized cost^[[Amortized cost refers to the purchase price of an asset, adjusted for factors like interest rates and payments over the lifetime of the asset. It allows assets to be valued on financial statements in a way that accounts for changes in value over time as the asset is used or paid off.](https://www.google.com/search?q=amortized+cost)] method for certain short-term securities.* <br/>\n",
    "Fund managers must provide accurate and up-to-date valuations of their funds' assets, which is crucial for determining the price at which units in the fund can be bought or sold ^[Regulation 48(1) and Regulation 49(5) of the Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001].\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Disclosure requirements:** *Regular reporting of fund performance, fees, and portfolio composition to investors and the CMA.* <br/>\n",
    "The Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001, outline key disclosure requirements for Kenyan fund managers. These include weekly publication of unit prices (Regulation 40), quarterly reports to the CMA and trustees on portfolio, activities, and performance (Regulation 42), and annual audited financial statements. Regulation 45 requires distribution of detailed annual and semi-annual reports to all investors, covering financial information, portfolio composition, and performance metrics. These rules ensure transparency in fund operations and regular communication with both regulators and investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Risk management:** *Implementation of robust risk management systems and stress testing procedures.* <br/> \n",
    "Part IV, Section 9 of the Capital Markets (Risk Based Supervision of Licensees of the Capital Markets Authority) Guidelines, 2020, guidelines requires licensees, including fund managers, to develop and implement a risk management framework that includes stress testing and covers the identification, assessment, monitoring, controlling, and reporting of all material risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Liquidity requirements:** *Maintaining a minimum percentage of assets in highly liquid instruments to meet redemption requests.* <br/> A person is eligible for a licence to act as a trustee of a collective investment fund if that person has a minimum liquid capital of five million shillings or eight per cent of its liabilities which must be maintained throughout the duration of the license^[PART V 32 (c), Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes)].\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Corporate governance:** *Appointment of independent trustees and compliance with the Code of Corporate Governance Practices for Issuers of Securities to the Public.* <br/> \n",
    "A person is eligible for a licence to act as a trustee of a collective investment fund if has as its directors and shareholders, persons who are fit and proper as provided under section 24A of the Act ^[PART V 32 (c), Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes)]. Additionally, the Code of Corporate Governance Practices for Issuers of Securities to the Public, 2015, provides comprehensive guidelines for corporate governance, which fund managers issuing securities to the public must comply with.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Marketing and advertising:** *Adherence to strict guidelines on marketing materials and performance representations.* <br/>\n",
    "The Capital Markets (Collective Investment Schemes) Regulations, 2001, provide guidelines on marketing and advertising for collective investment schemes. These regulations require CMA approval for all advertisements, mandate disclosure of potential value fluctuations, set standards for performance representations, and require warnings about past performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Investor protection:** *Establishment of clear procedures for handling investor complaints and maintaining segregated client accounts.* <br/> Regulation 22 requires the establishment of procedures for handling investor complaints, while Regulation 31 mandates the maintenance of segregated client accounts ^[The Capital Markets Act, Cap 485A, and the Capital Markets (Conduct of Business) (Market Intermediaries) Regulations, 2011]. Some fund managers dont have a way to tell that you have a unique and segregated account. In this era where automation is increadibly affordable, always prefer fund managers who have an online platform, an app or any other means where you can clearly see your money, initiate withdrawals and raise support tickets in real time. Some fund managers prefer you literally call them or explicitely write them an email to request a status of your account. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a fund manager breaking any of these regulations, take it as a red flag and prefarably follow up the matter with CMA at their complaint page, <https://portal.cma.or.ke/complaints/>. Unless your risk appetite is pretty high, in which case you should be not considering investing Money Market Funds, always prefer safely over interest... better safe than sorry!\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Unit trusts are required to publish their daily and effective annual yields on the daily newspapers, and thus an investor can therefore always confirm the value of their investment as well as benchmark the performance against other unit trusts.

    "\n",
    "Despite the requirements to have the daily yield published in two national newspapers, it is fairly tasking to find a good data source. Also, since there dont have to publish the newspapers that have digital precenese, it also becomes difficult to capture all yileds without visiting the library and grabbing the actual physical copies, which makes this task very expesnsive. Again, getting historical data is also not free, most old newspaper records are sold, adding up the cost. Fortunately, since 2014, Cytonn Fund Managers has been doing free market research, and publishing them at <https://cytonnreport.com/>. A few fund managers publish their daily yields at their websites, but without historical data; just the current day's yield, which effectively makes this data unuseful for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We settled on crawling and analysing the massive cytton research data that is publicly available since 2014. With over 600 reports with, we crawl each of the reports in a way that doesnt break their systems, or deny others the service, extract the table, aggregate the table results and analyze the tables. We checked with Cytonn's terms of service. users are allowed to use their copyright data in accordance with fair use/dealing, ^[Reproduction is prohibited other than in accordance with the copyright notice, which forms part of these terms and conditions. <https://cytonn.com/terms-of-use> ]. To allow others to reproduce this analysys, we will save a copy of the crawled raw data for future researchers and data enthusisists.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- According to Capital Markets Authority, fund managers are required to publish their yields daily in a reputable newspaper. What this means accessing hostorical records requires a significant investment in time to collect, aggregate and validate the published yields. That not withstanding, two very important questions become obvious:\n",
    " - what is a reputbale newspaper? \n",
    " - what yield do they publish, gross or net?\n",
    " - What picture does an anualized daily rate paint?\n",
    " - Is interest deffered or carried forward (reporting a convervative figure and retaining the rest for rainy day to preserve a picture of good performance)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, one of the fund managers, one that has recently found its self in the courts far more often than it would have wished, does exelent investment and market research. It has a good-enough aggregate of fund managers and their performance weekly and monthly. We are going to crawl their data for analysis, and analyze it for manipulation.If the data comeout clean, we will analyze the trend of fund managers using the data. -->"
