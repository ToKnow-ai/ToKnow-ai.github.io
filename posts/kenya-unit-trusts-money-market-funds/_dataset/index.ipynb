These funds operate by pooling capital from numerous investors, which professional fund managers then invest collectively in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments. "

    "In the Kenyan financial landscape, MMFs offer several advantages over traditional bank deposits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Higher Returns: MMFs typically provide superior interest rates compared to standard savings accounts.\n",
    "2. Lower Entry Barriers: Investors can start with smaller amounts, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n",
    "3. Compound Interest: Unlike most bank deposits that offer simple interest, MMFs generally provide compound interest, potentially leading to faster wealth accumulation.\n",
    "4. Liquidity: MMFs maintain high liquidity, allowing investors to access their funds quickly when needed, within a day or two after withdrawal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will delve into the performance and characteristics of various Money Market Funds in Kenya, utilizing publicly available data. Through this exploration, we aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Source and gather data\n",
    "2. Clean the data and perform simple EDA\n",
    "3. Archive and publish the data for further and future analysis\n",

    "This analysis will not only offer basic insights into the current state of these investments but also contribute to a broader understanding of unit trust investments in the Kenyan financial market.\n",

    "We have `49` **unique** and approved unit trust schemes as at {{< meta date-modified >}}. Schemes are normally managed by approved investment bank managers or approved fund managers. By investment bank, its not the traditional bank, but rather a CMA approved investment bank, such as \"BLA BLA BLA\". Traditional banks can also have fund managers. for example KCB has KCB Asset managers which is approved by CMA to manage \"BLA BLA BLA\". If an investment vehicle dont have an approved fund mannger ot investment bank, but they would like to have an approved scheme, they can norminate existing fund managers to manage the scheme for them. For example, *Mali Money Market Fund* ^[[Frequently Asked Questions / Mali](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/media-center-landing/frequently-asked-questions/mali)] ^[[Safaricom to launch unit trust, new savings service](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/safaricom-to-launch-unit-trust-new-savings-service-2288556)] which is wholly or partly owned by the Kenyan Telecommunications company, Safaricom PLC ^[[M-PESA / M-PESA Services / Wealth / Mali](https://www.safaricom.co.ke/main-mpesa/m-pesa-services/wealth/mali)], is not listed among licenced fund managers. According to Business Daily ^[[Safaricom's Mali unit trust asset base hits Sh1.4bn](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/markets/capital-markets/safaricom-s-mali-unit-trust-asset-base-hits-sh1-4bn--4582142)], Mali MMF is administered by Genghis Capital Limited, which is listed by CMA as an Investment Bank. Genghis Capital Limited also has its own unit trust fund called Gencap Hela Imara Money Market Fund ^[[Genghis Capital Unit Trust Fund](https://genghis-capital.com/asset-management/money-market-fund/)]. This may or may not raise a potential conflict of interest. \n",
    "Similaraly, there are fund managers that no longer offer Unit Turst investments under Money Makrket Funds, such as Zimele ^[[Zimele Savings Plan Transition: From Money Market to Fixed Income Fund](https://www.zimele.co.ke/zimele-savings-plan-transition-from-money-market-to-fixed-income-fund/)].

Fortunately, since 2014, Cytonn Fund Managers has been doing free market research, and publishing them at <https://cytonnreport.com/>.

    "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
