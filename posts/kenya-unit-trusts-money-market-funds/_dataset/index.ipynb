These funds operate by pooling capital from numerous investors, which professional fund managers then invest collectively in short-term, highly liquid financial instruments. "

    "In the Kenyan financial landscape, MMFs offer several advantages over traditional bank deposits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Higher Returns: MMFs typically provide superior interest rates compared to standard savings accounts.\n",
    "2. Lower Entry Barriers: Investors can start with smaller amounts, making them more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n",
    "3. Compound Interest: Unlike most bank deposits that offer simple interest, MMFs generally provide compound interest, potentially leading to faster wealth accumulation.\n",
    "4. Liquidity: MMFs maintain high liquidity, allowing investors to access their funds quickly when needed, within a day or two after withdrawal.\n",

    "3. Archive and publish the data for further and future analysis\n",

    "We have `51` approved unit trust schemes as at {{< meta date-modified >}}. Schemes are normally managed by approved investment bank managers or approved fund managers. By investment bank, its not the traditional bank, but rather a CMA approved investment bank, such as \"BLA BLA BLA\". Traditional banks can also have fund managers. for example KCB has KCB Asset managers which is approved by CMA to manage \"BLA BLA BLA\". If an investment vehicle dont have an approved fund mannger ot investment bank, but they would like to have an approved scheme, they can norminate existing fund managers to manage the scheme for them.

Genghis Capital Limited also has its own unit trust fund called Gencap Hela Imara Money Market Fund ^[[Genghis Capital Unit Trust Fund](https://genghis-capital.com/asset-management/money-market-fund/)]. This may or may not raise a potential conflict of interest. \n",
