    "Domain front-running^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_front_running] typically occurs when a domain registrar or associated party monitors search queries entered by users looking for available domain names. If the domain appears promising or marketable, the registrar may register it before the user, intending to profit by reselling it at a higher price. While registrars deny engaging in this practice, affected individuals and businesses find it challenging to prove due to limited transparency regarding how domain search data is managed and monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a personal level, I, along with several friends and family members, have encountered domain front-running. In one instance, after conducting an availability search for a domain through a popular registrar's website, the exact domain was unexpectedly registered within minutes (literally!). On average, short and simple domain names are typically lost within `12-72 hours` after searching, depending on where you searched and the TLD of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such incidents are far from isolated. Numerous domain seekers report similar patterns, noting that after searching for specific domains, these names quickly become registered by the same or affiliated registrars. This behavior leaves many users without clear explanations, contributing to widespread suspicion and concern. Evidence from personal experiences and community reports suggests that domain front-running remains an ongoing concern that affects domain seekers.\n",

    "### Best Practices for Private Domain Searches\n",
    "\n",
    "Claims of domain snatching by domain registrars underscore the need for domain seekers to understand the risks and methods for safeguarding their domain searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Official WHOIS Lookup Sites:\n",
    "   Instead of searching on a registrar's website, consider using a neutral WHOIS lookup service. Many of these services do not track or record searches, reducing the likelihood of domain front-running.\n",
    "   - ICANN lookup (https://lookup.icann.org/en) for `.com` domains\n",
    "   - Direct registry websites (e.g., [KENIC](https://rdap.kenic.or.ke/) for `.ke` domains)\n",
    "   - Avoid commercial registrars for initial searches, such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/domains) or [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Utilize command-line tools:\n",
    "   - Use terminal `whois` command (e.g., `whois example.com`). whois program is usually preinstalled in most unix systems. For Windows users, Microsoft offers a WHOIS utility that can be downloaded from [Sysinternals site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/whois).\n",
    "   - Minimizes exposure to potential monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time your searches strategically:\n",
    "   - Only search on commercial registrars when ready to purchase immediately\n",
    "   - Make sure you test your payment method before searching\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Research the Registrar's Reputation:\n",
    "   Before using a registrar, check reviews and forums for any reports or complaints about front-running. Users often share their experiences, which can help identify registrars with questionable practices.\n",
    "   - Avoid small resellers who may have less secure practices\n",
    "   - Understand that most resellers ultimately use major registrars' services, thus have less control over the monitoring of the domain searches\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Independent Domain Search Tools:\n",
    "   - Utilize unaffiliated services like our [private domain checker - https://toknow.ai/apps/private-domain-checker](https://toknow.ai/apps/private-domain-checker)\n",
    "   - Prefer open-source solutions for transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transparent Solution: Private Domain Checker\n",

    "- Platform accessibility issues in some regions (e.g., China^[whois.cnnic.cn is timming out in huggingface: https://www.chinatalk.media/p/hugging-face-blocked-self-castrating]) due to Hugging Face hosting restrictions. Consequently, domains with TLDs in restricted regions cannot be searched, such as `.cn` when Hugging Face is blocked\n",
