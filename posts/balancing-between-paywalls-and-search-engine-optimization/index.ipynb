   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "For users to discover your content, they need to find it in search engines such as Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. For best results, it makes sense to allow search engines to see the entire premium article, enabling them to suggest it when users search for similar content. This practice is called search engine optimization (SEO). You might have the best news content, but if no one can find it, it's essentially useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of allowing partial access to premium content while still restricting it to paid users is a delicate balance that most media houses must maintain. Users often find clever ways to circumvent paywalls to access paid content for free. There are online forums dedicated to discovering these vulnerabilities, such as \"[Bypassing Daily Nation Paywall](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/s96k01/bypassing_daily_nation_paywall/?rdt=48760)\" and \"[You can bypass most soft paywalls with a little CSS knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/lk1not/you_can_bypass_most_soft_paywalls_with_a_little/)\". The ideas shared in these forums are often simple but require basic programming skills to execute. Consequently, most people would prefer to pay rather than learn how to implement these bypasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some users create browser plugins that automatically do the heavy lifting, allowing effortless access to premium content. Browser plugin stores and code repositories containing paywall bypass tools are usually taken down, such as the well-known <https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome>. Yet, the code often finds a new home before removal, as seen with <https://github.com/nikolqyy/bypass-paywalls-chrome/releases/tag/most-recent> ^[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41294166].\n",
    "\n",
    "This cat-and-mouse game is time-consuming for media companies, as they must constantly identify which plugins are currently bypassing their paywalls. Additionally, executing DMCA takedown notices is not instantaneous. Even after a successful takedown, someone with a cloned repository can reupload the code or plugin, and the cycle continues. This strategy only affects publicly available plugins and ideas, and ironically, the more control attempts are made, the more it spreads awareness that the website can be bypassed. This may prompt users who previously paid willingly to feel short-changed and start seeking bypass methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this approach tends to target only well-known plugins and repositories. Lesser-known repositories continue to grow unnoticed (e.g., <https://github.com/nikolqyy/bypass-paywalls-chrome>). It's unlikely that users accustomed to accessing content for free will start paying even if access is restricted. Moreover, users who have already installed these plugins will continue to enjoy premium content without paying."

    "## A Better Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "After issuing a DMCA takedown notice, the next logical step is typically to modify aspects of your website, such as class names and arrangement of site contents, to render old bypass plugins ineffective. However, there's a more sophisticated solution that is scalable, cost-effective, and doesn't compromise search engine optimization.\n",
    "This improved approach involves maintaining a select list of search engines that are allowed to access all premium content for SEO purposes. This list may include Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Baidu, Yahoo, and Ahrefs. On your web servers, you would check the IP address of the calling client and perform a reverse DNS lookup to determine if the IP address is associated with the whitelisted search engines.\n",
    "Of course, this operation is nerwork expensive and should be optimized by caching the results for a set period, such as one week. This means that an IP address identified as belonging to a search engine would not need to be re-evaluated for approximately seven days. This strategy maintains a good balance between functionality and performance."

This method essentially allows the old CSS-based bypass technique to continue functioning.\n",
