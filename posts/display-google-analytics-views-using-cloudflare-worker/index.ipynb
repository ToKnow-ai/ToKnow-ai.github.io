    "When you set up a website, a blog, a vlog, or even a social media post, you expect some engagement. One of the simplest and most effective ways to measure engangement is through views. View count is effective because it measures both active and passive audience. However, not all views are actual views. For example, if oe user reloads the same page a thousand times, it doesnt mean a thousand users viewed the page, its just one user who refreshed the page a thousand times. It may even be the case that they never even viewed thecontents of the page even once. On the other hand, one user may come back time after time to the same page, actually reading the page content. this could be consired multiple views or reads. So to calculate an actual read, there needs to be some form of intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a blog or website, one of the simplest ways to add some intelligence is to delay sending the view or read signal by for example 7 seconds. Another way is to wait for the user to scroll a page to about half the page before triggering a read count.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, you could employ a free external service such as <https://visitorbadge.io>. <https://visitorbadge.io> receives the page url and returns an SVG image of the page count, for example, \n",
    "\n",
    "[https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path={{< meta html_uri >}}](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path={{< meta html_uri >}})\n",

    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ". One of the drawback of this strategy is we can't delay the tigger of view count and show the current views/reads af the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ofcourse, you can implement this, for sure, but you'd need some backend setup such as a store to save the views, and implement the logic to save and read the views. However, for a static websites and blog such as this one (hosted as github pages), that would go aganist the current architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative would be to utilize Google analytics, which is already added. Google analytics was not added just for the views, but to measure the overall health of the website/blog. But because they also monitor views in an intelligent way, why not just show the views they have calculated? after all, if google analytics is your primary analytics, thats where you go to see the health of the website/blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we dont affect the current architecture, we can use a cloudflare worker to fetch views from google analytics."

    ">  - [TypeScript](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/)\n",

That means we cant use the gogle python packages `google-auth-oauthlib` and `google-api-python-client`. We would have to create the authentication logic from scratch, which adds maintenance burden. \n",
    "Also for python, only HTTP libraries that are able to make requests asynchronously are supported. Currently, these include `aiohttp` and `httpx`. Also, python is not really a first class language in a true sense, it still uses webassembly and pyodide: <https://blog.cloudflare.com/python-workers/>.\n",

    "Despite Javascript and Typescript being the best languages to  implement the worker, there is also some limitations. Not all NodeJS packages and environment are supported.

This offsets alot of maintenance. <https://github.com/Schachte/cloudflare-google-auth> seems to be the package with latest mainteinance, but there are other older and possible working implementations and online discussions about authenticating and authorizing google API calls using Service Account credentials ^[node.js helper libraries Google provide don't work with Cloudflare workers] ^[<https://github.com/jazcarate/cloudflare-worker-google-oauth> and <https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/implementing-google-oauth-google-api-cloudflare-workers/>] ^[<https://ishwardatt.medium.com/creating-and-deploying-a-cloudflare-worker-with-nodejs-typescript-bde33963763f>] ^[<https://github.com/kriasoft/web-auth-library>] ^[https://community.cloudflare.com/t/example-google-oauth-2-0-for-service-accounts-using-cf-worker/258220] ^[https://gist.github.com/markelliot/6627143be1fc8209c9662c504d0ff205] ^[https://github.com/Schachte/cloudflare-google-auth] ^[https://gist.github.com/koistya/95776c2e948095906d48d7e7b04aad0b]\n",
