    "When you set up a website, blog, vlog, or social media post, you expect engagement. One of the simplest and most effective ways to measure engagement is through views. View count is effective because it measures both active and passive audience interaction. However, not all views represent actual engagement. For example, if one user reloads the same page a thousand times, it doesn't represent a thousand unique viewers - it's just one user refreshing repeatedly. They may not have even read the content. On the other hand, when a user returns multiple times to read content carefully, each visit could be considered meaningful engagement. To calculate actual reads, we need some intelligence in our tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a blog or website, one of the simplest ways to add some intelligence is to delay sending the view or read signal by for example 7 seconds. Another way is to wait for the user to scroll a page to about half the page before triggering a read count.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could employ a free external service such as <https://visitorbadge.io>, which receives the page url and returns an SVG image of the page count, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path={{< meta html_uri >}}](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path={{< meta html_uri >}})  \n",
    "\n",
    "returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.content-visible unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n",
    "![](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path={{< meta html_uri >}}){extract-media=\"false\"}\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the drawback of this strategy is we can't delay the tigger of view count and show the current views/reads at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ofcourse, you can implement this, for sure, but you'd need some backend setup such as a database to save the views, and implement the logic to save and read the views. However, for a static websites and blogs such as this one (hosted as github pages), that would go aganist the current architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative would be to utilize Google analytics. Google analytics can be added not just for the views, but to measure the overall health of the website/blog. If google analytics is your primary analytics tool for your website/blog, why not just show the views they have calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we dont affect the current architecture, we can use a cloudflare worker to fetch views from google analytics."

    "> Workers is a polyglot platform, and provides first-class support for the following programming languages:\n",

That means we cant use the gogle python packages `google-auth-oauthlib` and `google-api-python-client`. We would have to create the authentication logic from scratch, which adds maintenance burden. \n",
    "Also for python, only HTTP libraries that are able to make requests asynchronously are supported. Currently, these include `aiohttp` and `httpx`. Also, python is not really a first class language in a true sense, it still uses webassembly and pyodide: <https://blog.cloudflare.com/python-workers/>.\n",
