    "Money market is an investment unit trust, where fund managers collect money from public investors, and invested collectively. Money Market is a financial asset that is short-term, highly liquid. Compared to bank deposits, Money Market offers a higher interest with a lower barrier of entry. Besides a higher interest, money moarket accounts offer compound interest unlike bank deposts which mostly offer simple interest. Let's statistically and critically analyze Money market funds in Kenya in general using publicly available information and hopefully paint a picture of the state of unit trust investments in Kenya."

    "Despite the requirements to have the daily yield published in two national newspapers, it is fairly tasking to find a good data source. Also, since there dont have to publish the newspapers that have digital alternatives, it also becomes difficult to capture all yileds without visiting the library and grabbing the actual physical copies, which makes this task very expesnsive. Again, getting historical data is also not free, most old newspaper records are sold, adding up the cost. Fortunately, since 2014, Cytonn has been doing free makket research, and publishing them at <https://cytonnreport.com/>. A few fund managers publish their daily yields at their websites, but without historical data; just the current day's yield, which effectively makes this data unuseful for analysis.\n",

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
