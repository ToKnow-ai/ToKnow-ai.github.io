    "Despite the requirements to have the daily yield published in two national newspapers, it is fairly tasking to find a good data source. Also, since there dont have to publish the newspapers that have digital alternatives, it also becomes difficult to capture all yileds without visiting the library and grabbing the actual physical copies, which makes this task very expesnsive. Again, getting historical data is also not free, most old newspaper records are sold, adding up the cost. Fortunately, since 2014, Cytonn has been doing free makket research, and publishing them at <https://cytonnreport.com/>. A few fund managers publish their daily yields at their websites, but without historical data; just the current day's yield, which effectively makes this data unuseful for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We settled on crawling and analysing the massive cytton research data that is publicly available since 2014. With over 600 reports with, crawl each of the reports in a way that doesnt break their systems, or deny others the service, extract the table, aggregate the table results and analyze the tables.
